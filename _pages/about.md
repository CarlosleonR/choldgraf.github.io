I'm a fellow at the [Berkeley Institute for Data Science](https://bids.berkeley.edu/)
and a member of [Project Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/).

I work with teams to create and improve [open-source technology](opensource) for
scientists, educators, and data analysts. My goal is to help people do their
work more effectively, openly, and reproducibly.

I love coding, communicating, engaging with the community, and building
technology that helps people who are trying to make the world a better place.

I'm also a cognitive neuroscientist who uses predictive modeling to study
the ways in which the human [auditory system understands speech](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13654).
I also help to build tools that make it easier to analyze and share data from the
brain.

Check out the links above for more information on some of the things I've
been up to, or see [my blog](/) for some of my thoughts.
