The Docathon is a week-long global sprint where we focus our efforts on improving
the state of documentation in the open-source and open-science world.
This means writing better documentation, building tools, and sharing skills.

[The first Docathon](https://docathon.github.io/docathon/) was held in 2017,
and had participants from across the globe.

More than 40 open-source projects contributed, and in total we put out a
roughly ten-fold increase in contributions to documentation over the week!
