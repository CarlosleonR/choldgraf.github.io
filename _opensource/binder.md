Binder allows you to create custom computing environments that can be
shared and used by many remote users. It is powered by BinderHub, which
is an open-source tool that deploys the Binder service in the cloud. One-such
deployment lives at [mybinder.org](mybinder.org), which we run as a free service.

The goal of Binder is enable people to share reproducible, interactive versions
of their code with others as easily as possible. It is used by people across
the scientific, education, and analytics communities.
