MNE-Python is open-source software for exploring, visualizing, and analyzing
human neurophysiological data (MEG, EEG, sEEG, ECoG, etc).

After my PhD, I spent some time generalizing the code I had written for [receptive field
analysis](https://martinos.org/mne/stable/auto_tutorials/plot_receptive_field.html?highlight=receptive%20field)
of human ECoG data, which now exists in MNE-Python.
