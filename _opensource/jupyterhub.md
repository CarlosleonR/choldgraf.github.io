JupyterHub is a tool that lets an administrator serve many user sessions
from a single machine. The [Zero to JupyterHub guide](z2jh.jupyter.org) is an instructional and
opinionated guide to deploying a JupyterHub on Kubernetes, a framework for
deploying / managing cloud resources.

The Zero to JupyterHub guide was originally written as an extension of
the technical infrastructure for UC Berkeley's Data 8 course, and since then
has become the most popular method for running a JupyterHub at scale in the cloud.
