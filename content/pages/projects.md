Summary: Some projects that I'm working on.

Here's a place to keep track of some projects that I'm currently working on, past and present.

## Neuroscience Projects
* I recently published [a paper](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13654) that uses encoding models of brain activity to detect a change in how your auditory cortex tunes itself to speech in order to understand noisy speech.
* I'm working on an [introduction to data science in cognitive neuroscience](https://github.com/data-8/cogneuro-connector) class for undergraduates
* I'm writing a tutorial/methods paper along with [example jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/choldgraf/methods_encoding_model) on predictive models for cognitive neuroscience.
* I'm working to build an [open course in data science for neuroscience](https://github.com/neuro-data-science/neuro_data_science) to be a public repository of tutorials and how-tos on studying the brain.



*Alternatively, if you want an old-fashioned CV, [you can find a sort of up-to-date one here](http://predictablynoisy.com/extras/cv.pdf)*
