# Things that would help me help the Jupyter governance refactor

It has been about 7 months since the last Jupyter Team meeting, where it was decided
that we should undertake an effort to refactor the governance of the Project. For those
who aren't familiar with the situation, the *tl;dr* is that the Jupyter Project has
grown and diversified quite a lot over the last few years, and its current Governance
structure is due for an evolution. This process is meant to describe what the next
phase of its evolution should be.

Several community members have
[volunteered their time in weekly governance meetings](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/governance-office-hours-meeting-minutes),
and have spent a lot of time thinking about how the process should work, collecting data
about other projects' governance, etc. **Thanks very much** to the folks that have been
involved in this process so far. This is really important work, and I appreciate
the time you've put into jump-starting the process.

That said, over the last few months I've found it hard to participate in the governance
refactoring process. This isn't for lack of *wanting* to help, but because it was
unclear to me *how* to help in a way that is sustainable. I think
there is some low-hanging fruit that we can improve around
the process to make it easier for others (and me!) to jump in.

I want to highlight that this is *not meant as a critique of the process*,
but an attempt at giving some constructive feedback.


## Make regular posts and reminders about the governance meeting

In my experience, standing meetings quickly get lost in the background of other things
that scramble for your attention. Unless you plan on attending every single one and put
it on your calendar, it's easy to forget that a meeting is even happening after the
first few occurrences.

Suggestion:
**make an announcement about the governance meetings on the Sunday or Monday before each (Tuesday) meeting**.
Announce this in the community forum, and maybe the mailing list. If we really want open
participation, ping Twitter as well. This would activate the idea in people's minds and
potentially make them more likely to attend. Here's a short template that we could send out
each week, adapted from [Zach Sailor's language for the JupyterHub team meetings](https://github.com/jupyterhub/team-compass/issues/211):

```
✨ Attention Jovians ✨

The Jupyter governance committee is meeting every week to research and propose
changes to the project's governance structure. It invites your participation and input
in this process!

We have a weekly meeting to discuss latest developments, it is held on
_Tuesdays at 9:00am California time (4:00pm UTC)_.

The next meeting will be on **Tuesday, October 14th, 2019** at 9AM California time (or your [timezone](https://arewemeetingyet.com/UTC/2019-10-15/16:00/Jupyter%2FGovernance%20meeting)).

* You can find the agenda [here](<link to agenda>).
* And we'll meet on Zoom (video conferencing) [here](https://calpoly.zoom.us/my/jupyter)
* You can find minutes, notes, and action items from this process in [this community forum thread](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/governance-office-hours-meeting-minutes/1480/25)
```


## Make it easier to participate remotely / asynchronously

That said, attending a live meeting is still a big ask for many people. The Jupyter project is
international, and it's hard for many folks to make a meeting at a specific time. Moreover,
many people have other things to do, and so must carve out time for governance conversations
here and there.

Currently, there are [the governance office hours minutes](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/governance-office-hours-meeting-minutes)
which has a lot of helpful summary information. However, there is
a lot of missing information in there(e.g. there's talk of a plan and timeline,
and references to documents that I cannot find online anywhere.)
**There should be a single place that contains the current "state" of the governance refactor process**
including where we are, and what's left to be done.

On this point, I unfortunately can't do much since it seems there is information being
stored somewhere in a private place I don't have access to.


## Add more structure during and after the meeding

As we brainstorm new ideas and think through issues, there will be actionable places where
people can intersect and help out. Moreover, each of those pieces may (or may not) be discussed
in the meeting itself. Most people in the Jupyter community have limited time, and need to
decide ahead of time if they will attend a weekly meeting. It's hard to do this without
any kind of plan or agenda for these meetings.

**Weekly office hours should have an agenda and goal released at least 24H beforehand**
This would allow people to orient themselves beforehand and decide if they should make the meeting,
it would also help structure the meeting itself to ensure that the topics that are most important
are the ones that are discussed.

After the meeting, it would be helpful to include specific **calls for assistance** that
others who didn't attend can use to engage.


## Wrapping up, and a commitment to action

I recognize that it might come across as un-helpful to make suggestions at this point,
and I hope that these ideas are seen as something we can use improve the process. To re-iterate
a point above, I am deeply appreciative of the team of people who have worked on this so far.
If anybody wants to speak with me about any of these topics, I am happy to do so - I'll also
make more of a concerted effort to attend weekly meetings if possible.
