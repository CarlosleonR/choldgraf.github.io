# Things that would help me help the Jupyter governance refactor

It has been nearly 7 months since the last Jupyter Team meeting, where it was decided
that we should undertake an effort to refactor the governance of the Project. For those
who aren't familiar with the situation, the tl;dr is that the Jupyter Project has
grown and diversified quite a lot over the last few years, and its current Governance
structure is due for an evolution. This process is meant to describe what the next
phase of its evolution should be.

Several community members have been
[volunteering their time in weekly governance meetings](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/governance-office-hours-meeting-minutes),
and have spent a lot of time thinking about how the process should work, collecting data
about other projects' governance, etc. **Thanks very much** to the folks that have been
involved in this process so far, this is really important and complex work, and I appreciate
the time you've put into figuring this stuff out.

Throughout this process, I've found it a bit hard for myself to participate in the governance
refactoring process, and I want to use this post to highlight a few things that could be improved
that'd make it easier for me (and maybe others) to jump in. I want to highlight that this is
*not meant as a critique of the process so far*, but an attempt at giving some actionable
things to improve it.


## Make regular posts and reminders about the governance meeting

In my experience, standing meetings quickly get lost in the background of other things
that scramble for your attention. Unless you plan on attending every single one and put
it on your calendar, it's easy to forget that a meeting is even happening after the
first few occurrences.

**We should make an announcement about the weekly office hours for governance on the Sunday or Monday before each (Tuesday) meeting**.
This would activate the idea in people's minds and potentially make them more likely to attend. This announcement
could come in the form of a templatized tweet + Discourse post in order to make sure that people
see it.


## Make it easier to participate remotely

That said, attending a live meeting is still a big ask for many people. The Jupyter project is
international, and it's hard for many folks to make a meeting at a specific time. Moreover,
many people have other things to do, and so must carve out time for governance conversations
here and there.

**There should be a single place that contains the current "state" of the governance refactor process**.
Currently, there is [the governance office hours minutes](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/governance-office-hours-meeting-minutes)
which has a lot of helpful summary information. However, reading through this information there is
a lot of missing information (e.g. there's talk of a plan and timeline, and references to documents, that I cannot
find online anywhere.) It would be easier for me to catch-up and provide input if there were a single canonical
place where I can update myself on where we are, and what's left to be done.


## Add more structure during and after the meeding

As we brainstorm new ideas and think through issues, there will be several actionable places where
people can intersect and help out. Moreover, each of those pieces may (or may not) be discussed
in the meeting itself. As somebody who wants to help out, but who has limited time to do so,
it is helpful for me to:

1. Know ahead of time what will be discussed in a meeting, so that I can decide if I should move
   other appointments to attend.
2. Know after-the-fact what needs to be done after a meeting, so that I can decide if I can help
   get this done during the week.

**Weekly office hours should have an agenda released at least 24H beforehand, and a clear set of tasks to be completed by the next week**.
This would allow people to orient themselves beforehand and decide if they should make the meeting,
it would also help structure the meeting itself to ensure that the topics that are most important
are the ones that are discussed. In particular, if there were specific **calls for assistance**,
it would help others find ways to engage.


## Updating governance should be a process, not an event

Finally, I've noticed that the way we talk about governance makes it feel like a single
moment will occur when governance changes. I think this may cause us to make "perfect" an
enemy of "good enough", and discourage iterative, bite-sized updates in lieu of a single,
large change.

**We should break up governance refactoring into smaller steps**, and expect to be working
on these steps on an ongoing basis. Governaning is a never-ending process, and we'd do well
to take an iterative approach to improving our own commmunity's governance, much in the way
that we iteratively improve our codebases.


## Wrapping up, and a commitment to action

I recognize that it might come across as un-helpful to make suggestions at this point,
and I hope that these ideas are seen as something we can use improve the process. To re-iterate
a point above, I am deeply appreciative of the team of people who have worked on this so far.
If anybody wants to speak with me about any of these topics, I am happy to do so - I'll also
make more of a concerted effort to attend weekly meetings if possible.
